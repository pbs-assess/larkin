Changes implemented on 21 July 2023
- forecast no longer includes random error. A single, deterministic forecast is generated for each posterior draw.
- timevary input parameter was removed as this is determined by value of prior on omega
- the MLE of larkin model was included as an alternative to Bayesian estimation, in forecast() using cmdstanr's optimize() function
